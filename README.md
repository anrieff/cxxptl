A small, high-level C++ threading API, supporting Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (and possibly others).
Implements the ThreadManager/ThreadWorker paradigm, with the thread manager managing a pool of threads,
which are dispatched to tasks as soon as possible once created.

For a sample how to use the API, see tester.cpp
